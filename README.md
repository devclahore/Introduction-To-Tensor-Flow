# Introduction To Tensorflow

I have made 3 notebooks on Introduction to Tensorflow:

1. Tensorflow_Hello_World.ipynb

I have picked a parabolic log function and tried to train a shallow deep network on a few samples to generate the same function. The goal of this notebook is to give you an idea that how to build a simple network in Tensorflow


2. Tensorflow_Intro_NLP.ipynb
I have picked a dataset from kaggle related to fake-news and tired to show the steps you need to go through for solving an NLP based problem


3. Tensorflow_Computer_Vision.ipynb
i have taken the motivation to build this notebook from "TensorFlow in Practice Specialization - Coursera". It has covered important concepts of CV like convolution and pooling. It has also shown how to visualize images in the layers.
